While developing the Cheese class, some extreme slowdowns crept in, due to me not properly understanding data structures, yet.\
You can see those old graphs [here](https://technicjelle.com/BMUtils-PerformanceReports/index_old.html).\
There are some very nice-looking graphs on there from the time we optimised the heck out of it.\
